              In fact I have spent zero time debugging styles at work in the past year.
              Not some time, not a little bit of time, no time. Zero.

              Not zero time overall, on personal projects I've spend a huge amount of time on this,
              even making this presentation. But at work, this problem has been solved for me.

              At work I primarily work on a product called Mapbox Studio, which is a design tool for creating beautiful interactive maps.
              It's an incredibly complex app as you can see. There's a suite of design tools in here, dataset authoring and management.
              Data, image, and font uploading, hell, it even has account administration features built in.

              It's a very *very* complex app, exactly the kind of app you'd expect to have totally snarled, awful nasty css, but it doesnt.
              In fact it only has [[[some kilobytes]]] of app CSS, and like 80% of that is custom illustrations.
              The rest of our CSS is powered by a CSS library we share with mapbox.com, all our documentation pages, and pretty much everything 
              else we put out. That library is called "Assembly"

              Assembly is a css framework we built and use at mapbox. It's primarily the brainchild of mapbox developers 
              David Clark, Katy Decorah, Saman Bemel-Benrud, and Dana Sulit.
              
              Assembly is open source, you're 100% free to use it, I really enjoy it and feel 
              like it's very very well documented, but it's not been designed for widespread use, and I'm not here to tell 
              you to use assembly on your apps, but rather why embracing the paradigms that led us to create assembly work 
              well for us, and why they might work well for you too.

              That paradigm is "functional css", which basically means, classes only do one very small thing, and you compose them
              together to make larger things, just like functional programming. This is also sometimes -- often? -- called atomic
              css. I avoid this term because it's often conflated with the atomic css library, and the atomic design pattern coined
              by brad frost. So I'm going to be calling it functional CSS today.

              Functional CSS means composing larger numbers of smaller classes to reach the same outcome. This means that 
              you will encounter larger numbers of classes on a single element. If you had a whole page of elements that
              look like this, that would indeed be a complete nightmare, that would be hard to read and grok what's going on.

              You don't interact with this enormous classname vomit on a day-to-day basis. That verbosity should be stashed 
              away using a component system. This doesn't mean react component. This pattern can be used in React, Angular, Vue,
              or even HTML preprocessors like pug, nunjucks and more.

              If you're not using a component system, or template partials, to compose your UI, then you'll have to grapple with 
              more verbose classes. That said, if you're building a large app where scaling CSS is important, and you're not using 
              some type of reusable component system, its outside the scope of this talk but you should look at adopting one, 
              because it will make your life better, I promise.

              Surprise! They both do. But a class named "color-blue" is significantly more grokkable than a hex string.
              Functional CSS doesn't mean obtuse class names. What it means is class names that describe what a component looks like 
              like "a blue button" rather than what a component does or represents like "a primary button"

              What this eventually means is that components are not more than the sum of their parts, they are *exactly*,
               predictably and immutably the sum of their parts.

              Elegantly using the global nature of CSS along with the cascade lets you elegantly create complex styles with minimal code. The problem is that, well, it's really heckin hard!
              Show of hands how many folks work on a team where developers who aren't CSS experts write UI code? The cascade probably makes it hard for these folks, and as a result makes your whole team less productive.
              So it's true that functional CSS doesn't use the cascade, but that's not the worst thing.
              After all, many CSS paradigms, like BEM, have abandoned the cascade in exchange for simplicity and approachability.

              In a funcitonal CSS system, it's not as simple as editing the single class attached to an element. It's more about

              This, to me, is still my least favorite thing about functional css. I'm working on a browser exteinsion that i hope

              This opens up a second problem, finding HTML elements without semantic class names can be difficult.
              If you're using react or some system with ready made tooling, this is less of an issue, since you can use

              The biggest reason is guardrails, with functional css you can't just set any value to anything you want.
              You can set say...margin bottom to any value you please with inline styles. With functional CSS you can 
              only set it to values pre-approved by your design system.

              Functional CSS also supports super important things like media queries, pseudo elements, and keyframe animations,
              that aren't possible with inline styles.

              Inline styles are scoped to a single element, whereas a functional class has a one to many relationship with elements.
              With really complex UIs, this is a non trivial difference which *can* (but not always) cause layout jank when using 
              inline styles instead of Functional CSS.

              He makes some good points in here, and is someone I absolutely respect, so what I'm about to say isn't 
              meant as some kind of swing at him or his ideas.

              In this post he insists that content-semantic classnames, like "link-bar" are superior to visual-semantic classnames 
              like "col-3" or "mb-18", because the problems that visual-semantic class naming aims to fix is better addressed 
              by developers communicating with each other and forming pattern libraries.

              In this post, among some excellent points, he says that visually-semantic classnames might be easier for developers 
              to understand, following that up with this quote "but making things easier for yourself and other developers is not 
              your job".

              I could not disagree more with this. The easier style becomes for developers, the more quickly we are able to work.
              This means we can iterate more to find the best solution for users, reduce our surface area for bugs, spare more mental energy 
              for solving core problems, ship more features critical to our organizations, and yeah, have a better time at work.

              This tacit admission that funcitonal CSS's composed visually semantic class naming makes things easier for us is 
              the core reason why I think it's a great way to make your UI more scalable. So lets get into it.

              reduces stylesheet size. Because you use a discrete set of utilites to do all your styling, adding more
              markup, more components, more features DOES NOT mean more CSS, unlike in traditinoal cases, where you would
              probably create new classes to style the new components.

              At the end of the day what this means is that the cSS itself is *much* simpler, and you'll generally be working 
              in CSS files less, and in HTML more. This generally means more confidence that what you do wont have side effects

              To put it another way, Functional CSS classes do exactly what it says on the tin. This means they
              are very simple and can be used with absolute confidence.

            <Notes>
              Once a software system reaches a cetain amount of complexity, the greater challenge becomes distriguting rather 
              than reducing complexity.
              
              Functional CSS helps manage complexity by abstracting complexity into a place where it is more easily managed.

              Scaling CSS is hard enough, scaling complicated CSS becomes much more difficult. Once you start having CSS that 
              overrides other CSS, nested rules and conditions, making modifications to that CSS beigns to get more and more 
              difficult. Once your CSS goes "off the rails" it gets harder and harder to put it right again.

            <Notes>
              Functional CSS attemtps to sidestep this problem by keeping CSS a list of utilities, and moving complexity 
              into how those classes are composed. Essentially it moves complexity into markup. Because markup is easier 
              to isolate in components or template partials, this tends to be an overall win for scalability.

            <Notes>
              CSS classes often serve as a proxy, not just describing how a component looks, which is CSS's job,
              but also describing what a component is or does.

            />
            <Notes>
              In this example component, we're relying on style definitions to tell us that this component is a link bar,
              AND tell us what the link bar should look like.

              This means that markup, components, and style are all highly coupled, and it becomes difficult to scale because 
              when one must change, often so do the others. This has become so normalized that we don't even think about it
              anymore, but it doesn't have to be this way.

            <Notes>
              With funcitonal CSS, we rely on style utilities to define what a component looks like, and use either a component
              system, tempalte partials, or even a simple data-attribute to define a component's name and role.
              
              This decoupling means that it is far easier to change both markup and styles in isolation.

              Because Functional CSS means you don't have to write CSS to create or modify components, you just have 
              to know what classes are available. You still have to understand how CSS works, the box model, flex rules,
              and Grid, but it lowers the barrier to entry by restricting the CSS you "write" to a small subset of 
              available options.

              This is very important for scalability, because it makes the system more resiliet to a changing or growing team.

              I don't use functional css for everything. On personal projects I like to write my CSS by hand, mostly because 
              I don't want to create a design system and functional css classes around that system for small projects, and 
              also because it's fun to write CSS. I wanted to throw this out there so my enthusiasm for Functional CSS doesn't 
              come off as blind dogmatism.

              If you don't have a component system, its probably not worth switching.

              I feel like the usefulness of functional CSS can be captured with a few questions.
              If you answered yes to these questions, then functional CSS might be a good fit. I understand the temptation 
              to dismiss these questions, but I'm willing to bet that many people in this room have worked on a project where 
              this was the case.

              Whether your CSS is experiencing scaling problems is hard to capture in a slide, but it's likely that you can
              feel if it's happening.

              If you answered no to these questions, then that's awesome......and also are you hiring? Jokes aside I've worked 
              in environemnts where funcitonal CSS systems would have been unneccessary, I've worked in environments where they'd 
              have been overkill. BUt I've also worked in environments where it was remarkably helpful.

              Use assembly? maybe. We have our own defaults baked in, but you can clone the project and modify

              Maybe in the future this will change, and you'll be able to use assebmly to quickly and easily
              generate a clean custom CSS system, but at the moment, this takes some effort.

              Functional CSS's power flows from two facets: it puts re-use before everything else by restricting CSS to a set 
              of utilities. It also creates a hard division between the definition of a component's style from a component's role. 
              All the benefits of functional css: confidence, performance, all the things that make it so scalable flow from these 
              two points.

            <Notes>
              What all these plus points, all the scalability stuff what it all boils down to, is that you're now able to write 
              UI without writing CSS. This is both a big plus point, and a negative. Hell I enjoy writing CSS, and I bet 
              plenty of y'all do too.

              This is also why I imagine the reaction to functional CSS as an idea is so visceral. Folks don't want to stop 
              writing CSS. I get that. I don't want to stop writing CSS either.

              But on large projects, on projects where we first and foremost aim to ship value to users and create a more 
              inclusive environment for UI development, one where CSS expertise is not a barrier to participation, the 
              ability to write UI without writing new CSS becomes very valuable.

              Nobody knows your app, your problem, and your users like you do, and your design should reflect that.
